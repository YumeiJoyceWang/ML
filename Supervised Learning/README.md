## Exploring Supervised learning algorithms----Decision tree, AdaBoost, SVM, neural network, k-nearest neighbors

- Five supervised learning algorithms were applied to the same dataset to compare model performance
- Cross-validation and learning curves of five algorithms were plotted to analyze over fitting and model bias
- Hyperparameter tuning and feature dimension reduction to enhance model performance
