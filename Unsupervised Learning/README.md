## Exploring Unsupervised learning algorithms and dimensionality reduction

Two cluster algorithms and four dimentionality reduction algorithms were applied to the same dataset to compare model performance:

- k-means clustering
- Expectation Maximization
- PCA
- ICA
- Randomized Projections
- Random Forest
